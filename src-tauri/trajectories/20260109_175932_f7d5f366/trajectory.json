To implement \"auto xem video kuaishou\" (auto-watch Kuaishou videos), I need to analyze the current screen and understand how to automatically scroll through videos. I can see there are video thumbnails and content on the screen. The typical auto-watch functionality would involve scrolling to the next video after a certain time interval to simulate watching multiple videos automatically.\n\nLooking at the UI elements, I can see video content and interactive elements. I should implement a simple auto-scroll mechanism that will swipe up periodically to move to the next video.\n\n**Agent Action:**",
